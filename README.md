# DILNETSA website

Update the files in src/, commit, and push to GitHub. Cloudflare should update the website automatically within a few minutes.
Make sure not to put any important/private files within the src/ directory, as the entire directory will be uploaded
and made accessible.

The current deployment can be found at: [dilnet.lowkeytowers.com](https://dilnet.lowkeytowers.com)
